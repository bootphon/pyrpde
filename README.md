# pyRPDE

A full-python implementation of the Recurrence Period Density Entropy metric.
It's based on the algorithm described in [1], and based on Max Little's 
R (and C) implementation in [2].

## Installation

This package needs python >= 3.6, and relies on Numba, Scipy, and Numpy.
It's available on pypi, so a simple:

```shell
pip install pyrpde
```

should do the trick.
